For the Pi Cluster, I found the following commands from this blog:

In that blog, they mentioned the following commands:

To turn on a cluster Pi (this enables SSH'ing to the individual Zero's, and it turns on the power LED on the cluster):
clusterhat on p1
clusterhat on p2
clusterhat on p3
clusterhat on p4

To SSH from the controller Pi to a cluster Pi:
ssh pi@pi1.local
ssh pi@pi2.local
ssh pi@pi3.local
ssh pi@pi4.local
